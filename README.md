### Above are my proposed solutions for CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python, 2024 edition.
### Each solution to the problem sets contained within this repository is meticulously annotated with comments, aiming to facilitate a deeper understanding of the code's logic and execution flow for all python beginneers, just like me!

### Final Project: [Simple Table Tennis Game üèì](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wL_XpK6ztc)
### In contrast to other accounts, I have included both my project codes and test codes within this repository for reference purposes, aiding others in crafting their own final projects for this course. Please be aware that the program is designed to operate solely on Windows devices.
